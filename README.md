# huffman_compression

Compression using Huffman coding in Rust

## Usage

```sh
cargo run [--release] <compress|decompress> <input file> [output_file]
```

For compression the output file defaults to `out.hfm` and for decompression the output file defaults to whatever the original name of the file was.
